Search history includes keywords such as “cutting bangs,” “dyeing hair,” and “weight concerns,” which are statistically aligned with female-associated behaviors. The user exhibits probable characteristics of being underweight and shows specific self-consciousness regarding hair appearance.

Based on keyword searches like “best colleges in New York,” The User is projected to be 18 years old and in the process of applying for higher education, with inferred geographic location in New York. Behavioral markers suggest that the user possesses a cautious, anxious, spiritual, and creative disposition.
